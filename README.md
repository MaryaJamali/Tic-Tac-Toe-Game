## Description:
A simple Tic Tac Toe game ( ‚ùå , ‚≠ï ) written in the popular Python language and run as a text.
In this game, two players alternately enter their turns with "X" and "O" marks on a 3x3 table.
The goal of this game is for one of the players to place their three distinctive marks in a row, column or diagonal of the table and win.
If all the houses on the table are filled and no one wins, the game ends in a draw.<br/>
This code uses functions such as printing the game table, checking if the player wins, checking if the game is tied, and receiving the player's move.
Also, there are functions for basic game play and player turn management.
